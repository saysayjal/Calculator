<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/saysayjal/Calculator)

This calculator was made as a task assigned for an entry submission for a fellowship. However, I got too excited and decided to experiment on some fun features which have been included in this project.

They are:
* Intuitive functionality which can be used by anyone.
* Transformation toggle for bringing scientific buttons on the default calculator.
* Addition of a toggle for dark mode for the users at night.
